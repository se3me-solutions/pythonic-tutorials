# Welcome young Pydawan 🤓🤘

## We are [Se3Me Solutions](https://www.se3me.com) 🌈

### You're about to become a professional in python! But first, some explanations...

* You'll have in the folder "tutorials" markdown files (.md) with all the tutorials you need, and you can consult them whenever you want;
    - **Note**: in some tutorials you have a little anotation to an exercise. It's good to do them after that tutorial.

* You have the "challenges" folder, and there will be some challenges to do with the tutorials. And what if you don't know why the exercise isn't correct? Just check the corresponding solution in "solutions".
    - **Note**: everything has it's unique and special essence. So, if the solution doesn't match yours (but your works), no worries. It's good to be different 😉.

* Now, before you get bored, if you want to contribute with some exercises or maybe fix something in the tutorials, feel free to do it 🕊, just read CONTRIBUTING.md.

#### Thanks for your attention! 😘
