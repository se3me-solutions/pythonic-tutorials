# Tutorial no¬∫ 1 - Installing Python üêç

If you are here, congrats! Now you're starting our python course!

To do:

* Install python in our machine (you can skip this tutorial if you're using Linux)

------

Installation step by step:

* Go to [python.org](https://www.python.org/)
* Mouse hover "Downloads"
* Click in "Python 3.X.X"
    - **Note**: it's importante to be the version **3** of python, not the 2
* Now just click and run the setup
    - **Note**: make sure you select the option "Add python to PATH" (in case you're using Linux)

------

Now, after the installation is complete, just look for "Python" (if you're on Windows) and this three applications should appear:

* Python 3.X Manuals
* Idle (Python 3.X Y bits)
    - **Note**: y is the version. It can be 86 or 64 bits
* Python 3.X Module Docs 

What, this didn't appear to you? No worries, just try to do these steps again!
