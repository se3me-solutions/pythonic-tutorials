# Tutorial noÂº 3 - Boxes...? An? ğŸ¤”ğŸ“¦

One of the things we use the most in programming is **variables**.
But...

### What the heck is variables?

Let's make an analogy, between boxes and this variables.

A variable is much like a box! However, you can only save one single value like one number, one name, ...

In example: you're moving you're things from your room to your step sister's room (**lenny face**) and you have a remote controlled car and a ball. You'll put the remote controlled car in one box and the ball in the other.

That "box" is a variable, that has a name and a content.

To declare (create) a variable we write something like this:

> {name} = {content}

* **Note**: those curly braces are just to demonstrate.

### Confused? So am I, let's give some examples...

* name = "Miguel"
    - Here the variable name is "name" and the content is "Miguel"

* age = 16
    - Here the variable name is "age" and the content is "16"

* school = "Colgaia"
    - Here the variable name is "school" and the content is "Colgaia"

You got the idea, right? So, let's continue...

### What to do with variables?

The most obvious thing to do with variables is to print it's content.
You can do it typing:

> print({variable_name})

And you can also print variables with some text:

> age = 16

> print("Hello, you're",age," years old, right?")
