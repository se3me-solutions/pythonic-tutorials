# Tutorial noº 4 - Data types! (Yes, they have gender too!) 🏳️‍🌈
When we're programming we have several "data types".

These data types are basically a gender of the value.

For example, when we look at someone, we can tell if he/she is a boy/girl.
With information too: you can tell if something is a word/setence, a number, and so on...

Now...

### Which data types exist in programming?

Let's only cover the basic ones:

* **Integer** » these are all integers (e.g: 10 ; -6 ; 616)
* **Float** » these are floating numbers (e.g: 0,8 ; 20,6 ; 4,20)
* **String** » these are sentences or words, and they have more than 1 character (e.g: "Marisa", "Alexandra", "Vasco")
* **Boolean** » this type only has two values True or False
* **Char** » this is only one character (e.g: "M", "h", "O")

* **Note**: python chooses the data type of a variable automatically bearing in mind it's content. However, you can restrict it doing this:
    
> age = 40  » here the age is 40

> age = float(age) » here the age will be 40.0

And the same goes for other data types.
