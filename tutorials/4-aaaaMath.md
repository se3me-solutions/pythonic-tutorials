# Tutorial noº 5 - Programming is not math! 1️⃣ ➕ 2️⃣ = 4️⃣

So...
We know that maths have a really important relationship with software and computer in general.

In this super quick tutorial we'll learn the basic operations:

* "+" » plus (a + b)
* "-" » minus (a - b)
* "/" » division (a / b)
* "*" » multiplication (a * b)
* "%" » modulus (a % b)
* "**" » exponentiation (a ** b)

### You can print math expressions

> print(5 + 9) » 14

And you can even do math with variables, but only if they are of the type integer or float.

> a = 6

> b = 6
 
> print(a + b) » 12
